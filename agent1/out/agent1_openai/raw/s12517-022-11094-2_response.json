  "abstract": "Delimiting mineralization targets executing various exploratory data is a challenging issue especially in deposit scale studies. This scope is not feasible by applying an integration method alone. Therefore, integrating some reliable mineral potential maps with presenting uncertainty map (hybrid technique) is the best procedure which has high confidence level for exploration of a mineralization deposit. The proposed hybrid approach was evaluated through P-A plots and field checking for confirming its power and accuracy in detecting mineralization outcrops from Zafarqand porphyry Cu-Mo deposit.",
