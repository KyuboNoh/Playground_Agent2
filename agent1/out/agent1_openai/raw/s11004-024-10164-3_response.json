  "abstract": "This study presents an improved unsupervised domain adversarial adaptation network for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) using synthetic datasets. The method addresses challenges in transferring geological knowledge across areas with different ore-forming characteristics. The network demonstrated superior performance in identifying high-potential zones for gold polymetallic mineralization in Hubei Province, China, providing valuable insights for mineral exploration.",
