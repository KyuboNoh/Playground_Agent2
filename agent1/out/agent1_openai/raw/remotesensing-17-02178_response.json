  "abstract": "Gold is a vital strategic resource for many countries. The Laozhaiwan area is an important gold resource base in Yunnan Province and even nationwide. Conducting mineral resource exploration in this region to increase gold reserves is of great significance. The application of remote sensing technology in mineral resource exploration is a green and efficient technical approach, which has been widely utilized in the field of mineral resource prospecting. This study selects the Laozhaiwan area in the southeastern part of Yunnan Province as the research region. Linear and ring structures were extracted using the remote sensing visual interpretation method based on Sentinel-2A multispectral data. Additionally, Sentinel-2A, ASTER, and ZY1-02D data were used to extract iron-stained, hydroxyl, silicification, and limonite alteration information through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) methods. A comprehensive analysis of geological data reveals that alteration minerals and linear-ring structures are closely related to mineralization, providing valuable indicators for mineral resource exploration.",
