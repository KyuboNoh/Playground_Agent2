  "abstract": "Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is an essential part of mineral discovery, which has conventionally gone through a process dependent on geoscience experience and manual data interpretation. Due to the swift development of remote sensing-based technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the study of the mineral-rich zones has undergone a paradigm shift. The proposed method of incorporating AI in remotely provided sensory data can be used to automate and improve the precision of MPM. The suggested system was applied on a well documented area of mineralization where the results have shown that the effectiveness of AI models to the conventional method is far superior to the traditional in terms of accuracy of the prediction and spatial generalization.",
