  "abstract": "This study proposes an integrated framework for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) using Bagging-based positive-unlabeled learning (BPUL) and Bayesian cost-sensitive logistic regression (BCSLR) to address uncertainties from imbalanced data and cost-sensitive issues. The framework was applied in the Wulong Au district, China, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. Return-risk analysis identified low risk-high return exploration targets.",
