  "Abstract": "Exploration for strategic mineral resources, like precious metals, in remote areas of the Greater Kurile Chain is challenging. Climate and weather conditions, dissected relief, soil and forest cover in this region impede acquisition of geological data. Mineral exploration requires development of fast and cost-effective methods that allow processing of insufficient and fragmented data like spaceborne images. Consideration of specific defoliation technique of directed principal components (DPC) and mineral mapping as well as application of assessment technique of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt, also Logistic Regression, logit) led us to use Landsat 8 OLI for modeling of mineralization distribution in the Kunashir and Iturup Islands.",
