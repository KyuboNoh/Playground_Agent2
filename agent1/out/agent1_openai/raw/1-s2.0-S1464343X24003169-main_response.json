  "abstract": "This study addresses challenges in Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) by enhancing methodologies for integrating geospatial data. It utilizes geological, airborne geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing datasets to develop evidence layers for gold exploration in a region with limited known deposits. The prediction-area method assesses layer weights independently of expert bias, leading to a gold prospectivity map created through a modified TODIM and multi-index overlay method. The modified TODIM method improves efficiency in managing alternatives and is benchmarked against the index overlay method.",
