  "abstract": "This study develops a Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) method that integrates data and knowledge for geological interpretation. Using stream sediment geochemical assays and a geological map knowledge graph, we construct catchment basins to constrain spatial geochemical interpolation. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeds geological knowledge, and K-means clustering classifies samples for training an XGBoost model for gold prospectivity prediction. Results show improved prediction performance, with key elements associated with gold mineralization identified.",
