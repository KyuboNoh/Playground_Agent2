  "abstract": "Identifying potential and mineralized areas with a reasonable level of confidence is a complex issue. The use of supervised methods and machine learning could help to achieve better results in such studies. This study proposes a porphyry copper mineralization model using a combination of data-driven methods, supervised machine learning, and multivariate decision-making methods. The results confirm that the MOORA method is more successful in producing the desired mineral potential model.",
