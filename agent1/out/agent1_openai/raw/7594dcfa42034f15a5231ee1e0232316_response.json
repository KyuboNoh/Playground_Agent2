  "abstract": "Exploration for graphite in Canada is of economic, strategic and governance priority. This study aimed to develop a reliable prospectivity map for graphite in Canada, mitigating multiple sources of workflow-induced uncertainty. By averaging an ensemble of de-correlated models, a consensus map and an uncertainty map were produced. The MPM products showed excellent spatial variability, aligning with existing knowledge of graphite deposits in Canada, indicating that combining data-driven rigor with independent interpretation enhances robustness.",
