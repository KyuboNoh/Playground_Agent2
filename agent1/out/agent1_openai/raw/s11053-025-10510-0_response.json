  "abstract": "Data engineering is a challenge in mineral prospectivity mapping using supervised data-driven methods due to a general paucity of true samples. This paper proposes a recursive annotation method based on positive and unlabeled learning to annotate negative samples, which improves model performance and spatial continuity of prospectivity maps. The method was applied to a graphite prospectivity map in Canada, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing mineral exploration.",
