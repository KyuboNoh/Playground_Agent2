  "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid model combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for mineral prospectivity mapping. The PSO algorithm fine-tunes hyperparameters, enhancing prediction accuracy for porphyry-type Cu mineralization in the Kerman belt, SE Iran. The model integrates diverse datasets and evaluates performance using multiple validation methods, demonstrating superior accuracy in identifying mineral-rich zones.",
