  "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is becoming an appealing tool in various fields of Earth Sciences, especially in mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) to support mineral exploration. ML algorithms are designed to assume a relatively balanced amount of training data for the estimation of the decision boundaries between the classes of interest. However, in MPM the numbers of mineralized and non-mineralized locations are naturally imbalanced. The use of imbalanced data leads to difficulties in the training of ML models for MPM. This study evaluates the effects of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) on the performance of MPM using support vector machine for Cu-Au prospectivity modeling in the Caraj\u00e1s mineral province (Brazil). The results show that SMOTE can significantly increase the performance and spatial efficiency of MPM.",
