  "abstract": "This study presents a three-dimensional mineral prospectivity mapping (3DMPM) approach using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm for the Lannigou gold deposit in Guizhou, China. The model integrates geological data to establish a 3D model and a prospectivity model based on metallogenic systems and geological anomalies. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance compared to the weights of evidence method in terms of prediction accuracy.",
