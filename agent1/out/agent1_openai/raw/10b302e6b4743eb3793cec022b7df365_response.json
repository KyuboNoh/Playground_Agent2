  "abstract": "This paper examines how augmented positive labels and different negative label selection procedures geospatially represent economically viable mineral deposits and affect deep learning-based mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) classification performance and spatial selectivity. The study provides insights into how different label sets affect MPM\u2019s classification performance and spatial selectivity, indicating that selecting negative class labels from geospatially different localities enhances classification performance compared to other negative label selection procedures.",
