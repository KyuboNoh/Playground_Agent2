  "Abstract": "This study applies machine learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict mineral prospectivity using satellite remote sensing data and limited field datasets. The RF model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for copper deposits in North Waziristan, Pakistan, suggesting its suitability for mineral exploration. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating remote sensing data with field information for effective mineral prospectivity mapping.",
