  "Abstract": "This study implemented ensemble learning of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) models for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) of magmatic hydrothermal tin polymetallic deposits in Xianghualing District, southern Hunan Province, China. A Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) was employed to optimize hyperparameters, significantly improving model performance. The XGBoost model outperformed the RF model in accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and kappa coefficient, demonstrating its potential for MPM.",
