  "abstract": "This study proposes an approach to detect iron-apatite mineralization and paragenesis related to Iron deposits by applying an image fusion based on deep learning (FDL) on exploration datasets. The exploration dataset includes remote-sensing, airborne geophysics, stream sediment geochemistry, and geological maps. The Prospectivity model was based on logical relations between each layer or sublayer extracted features and classes. The results indicate potential regions as Mineral Prospectivity Map (MPM) using fusion-based deep learning algorithms.",
