  "Abstract": "This study addresses limitations in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) due to insufficient labeled samples and the complexity of geological prospecting big data. A random-drop data augmentation method is proposed to generate sufficient training samples. The CNN architecture is optimized for MPM, resulting in strong spatial correlations with known mineralization locations, indicating its effectiveness in predicting rare geological events.",
