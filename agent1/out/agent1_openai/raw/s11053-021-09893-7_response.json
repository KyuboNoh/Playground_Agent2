  "abstract": "This study presents a machine learning-based approach for 3D modeling of mineral prospectivity mapping in the Anqing orefield, which has been extensively explored. By integrating various geological factors and exploration data, the study aims to identify high-potential targets for mineral exploration. The random forest algorithm was found to be particularly effective in predicting mineralization zones, emphasizing the importance of accurate geological data and sample selection in the modeling process.",
