  "abstract": "This study designs and adapts recurrent neural network architectures and a random forest algorithm to incorporate the temporal nature of ore-forming subsystems into mineral prospectivity analysis. Using a dataset of Pb-Zn mineralization in Semnan Province, Iran, the exploration targets in the prospectivity maps show excellent agreement with deposit locations, demonstrating the importance of incorporating the chronology of geological processes in targeting mineral deposits.",
