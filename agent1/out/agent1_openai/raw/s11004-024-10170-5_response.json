  "abstract": "The graph convolutional network (GCN) has proven to be a powerful tool for exploration criterion identification and mineral prospectivity analysis. However, the graph convolution of the GCN can result in over-smoothing of output features, undermining the reliability of mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). To address this, we introduce a novel model, the self-ensembling graph convolutional network (SEGCN), which integrates the mean teacher model with a GCN for MPM. A case study for tungsten polymetallic prospectivity analysis in the Nanling belt, China, demonstrates that the SEGCN model significantly outperforms conventional models in mapping tungsten polymetallic prospectivity.",
