  "abstract": "This study applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify fertile [for porphyry Cu and (or) Au systems] and barren adakites using geochemical data from New Brunswick, Canada. It emphasizes that not all intrusive units, including adakites, are inherently fertile and should not be directly used as the heat source evidence layer in mineral prospectivity mapping without prior analysis. A dataset of 99 fertile and 66 barren adakites was analyzed using seven ML models: support vector machine (SVM), neural network, random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and logistic regression. SVM achieved the highest performance (AUC = 0.91), followed by gradient boosting (0.90) and RF (0.89). Statistical analysis identified middle rare earth elements (REEs), including Gd and Dy, with Hf, as key indicators of fertility.",
