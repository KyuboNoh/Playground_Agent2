  "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to generate the mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) for a porphyry copper mineralization area. First, three information layers of geochemistry, geophysics, and geology were defined as the main criteria with a total of 13 sub-criteria. A multivariate geochemical analysis (MGA) was performed to reduce the number of measured elements to those most related to Cu mineralization. The final step involved discriminant analysis (DA), PCA, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) analysis to identify the main elements related to Cu mineralization. The PROMETHEE method was then applied to generate MPMs in Arc GIS 10.5 software, identifying promising areas for future exploration programs.",
