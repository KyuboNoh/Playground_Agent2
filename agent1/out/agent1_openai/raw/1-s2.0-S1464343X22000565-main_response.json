  "abstract": "This study employs a data-driven approach to evaluate the comparative relevance of geospatial components for gold mineralization in the southern Kibi-Winneba belt, Ghana. Using logistic functions and prediction-area plots, the study identifies effective evidential layers for mineral prospectivity mapping. The results indicate that hydroxyl concentration is the most significant indicator for gold mineralization, while potassium concentration is deemed non-indicative. A mineral prospectivity map was generated, enhancing predictive capabilities compared to individual evidential layers.",
