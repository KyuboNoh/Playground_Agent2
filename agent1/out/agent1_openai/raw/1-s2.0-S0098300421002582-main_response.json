  "abstract": "This study develops a joint workflow combining a singularity-based weighting method and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The approach evaluates geological features' importance for mineralization and integrates them using LSTM to extract deep geological information. A case study targeting Fe mineralization in southwestern Fujian Province, China, demonstrates the effectiveness of this method, revealing that known Fe deposits are located in high prospective regions identified by the model.",
