  "abstract": "Geochemical exploration data plays a vital role in mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) for discovering unknown mineral deposits. In this study, compositional balance analysis (CoBA), unsupervised and supervised learning are collaboratively used to improve the practice of identification of geochemical anomalies related to mineralization in the Qulong-Jiama mining district of Tibet. The iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA) and isolation forest (iForest) are used for preprocessing the geochemical data and optimizing the appropriate training sets for supervised learning. The results indicate that supervised learning can effectively delineate prospective areas, although a hybrid of CoBA, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning could provide better insights into MPM using the geochemical data.",
