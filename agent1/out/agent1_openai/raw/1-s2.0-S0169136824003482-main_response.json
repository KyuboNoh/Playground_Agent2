  "abstract": "Prospectivity analysis is an important part of the exploration information system (EIS) and mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a widely used technique for prospectivity analysis. This study demonstrates how re-designing exploration data into a graph format that focuses on spatial relationships can increase the effectiveness of MPM. The use of graph deep learning was applied to three different commodities (copper, iron, and tin) in the southern United Kingdom, showing significant performance improvements compared to conventional ML techniques, particularly when trained with imbalanced datasets.",
