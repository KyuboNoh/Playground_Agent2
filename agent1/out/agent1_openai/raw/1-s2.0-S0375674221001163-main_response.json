  "Abstract": "Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) is a multifaceted process relying heavily on experts' judgments. This study proposes a methodology for modulating the effects of subjectivity in knowledge-driven MPM, combining Monte Carlo simulation with fuzzy logic. The proposed procedure returns three components: a modulated prospectivity model, uncertainty, and confidence. Low-risk targets occupy merely 0.5% of the study area, showcasing the framework's efficacy for reducing the search space in greenfield exploration.",
