  "Abstract": "Mineral Prospectivity Mapping has been applied to define exploration targets for orogenic gold mineralization in the Malartic-Val-d\u2019Or area of the Abitibi greenstone belt. This research utilizes lithological, geophysical, and structural data to investigate factors controlling gold distribution. Stepwise logistic regression and random forest algorithms were employed to map mineral prospectivity for gold potential. The random forest method outperformed logistic regression, indicating strong predictors for distinguishing mineralized and non-mineralized locations.",
