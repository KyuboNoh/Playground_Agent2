  "abstract": "Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) is shifting toward intelligent deep mineralization searches in the era of big data and the increasing difficulties of surface deposit detection. Comparative analysis of two forms of mineralization prediction based on the Apriori algorithm was performed in the Meiling South mining area in the eastern Hami region of Xinjiang, China. The study utilized the Apriori algorithm to mine ore-forming information and determine ore-forming voxel positions, comparing these with predictions from Gaussian Naive Bayesian (GNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. The results demonstrated that the Apriori algorithm effectively identifies high and low-grade ore bodies and provides valuable insights for mineralization prediction.",
