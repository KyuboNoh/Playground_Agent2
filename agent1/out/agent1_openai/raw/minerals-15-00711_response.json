  "abstract": "Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a pivotal technique in geoscientific mineral resource exploration. This study proposes a T-GCN model integrating Transformer with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to address challenges in current deep learning applications for mineral resource prediction. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 97.27% in the PangXD ore district, successfully identifying five prospective mineralization zones.",
