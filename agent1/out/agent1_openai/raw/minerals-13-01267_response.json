  "abstract": "Random Forest classification was applied to create mineral prospectivity maps (MPM) for orogenic gold in the Rainy River area of Ontario, Canada. Geological and geophysical data were used to create 36 predictive maps as RF algorithm input. Eighty-three (83) orogenic gold prospects/occurrences were used to train the classifier, and 33 occurrences were used to validate the model. The prospectivity mapping results show high performance for the training and test data in area-frequency curves. The F1 accuracy is high and moderate when assessed with the training and test data, respectively.",
