  "abstract": "This study introduces a deep self-attention model for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), integrating multi-source data to enhance accuracy. The model captures internal relationships between evidence layers and considers spatial heterogeneity. A case study in the Suizao district, Hubei Province, China, demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting gold mineralization, achieving an accuracy of 0.88. The results suggest that the model can guide future mineral exploration.",
