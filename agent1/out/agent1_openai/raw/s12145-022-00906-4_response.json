  "abstract": "The largest Au\u2013Ag deposits in the eastern Asian region occur along the borders of cratons and superterranes. This research focuses on the Kema Terrane and Kema Metallogenic Belt in Southeast Russia, utilizing machine learning and field sampling to delineate prospective areas for epithermal Au\u2013Ag deposits. The study employs directed principal component analysis of ASTER data to enhance mineral detection and applies the MaxEnt method to generate a mineral occurrence probability map, revealing new areas with high mineral occurrence probability.",
