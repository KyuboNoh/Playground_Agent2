  "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis using supervised and unsupervised methods to determine predictive variables (PVs) for mineral prospectivity mapping. Twelve variables were created based on a mineral deposit model, and methods such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) and sparse principal components analysis (SPCA) were employed to identify PVs. The weights-of-evidence and Random Forest methods were used to integrate these variables into a probability map of mineral prospectivity, evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The findings highlight the importance of PV determination in enhancing mineral prospectivity predictions.",
