  "abstract": "This study proposes a hybrid model combining logistic regression (LR) with gene expression programming (GEP) for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The hybrid GEP\u2013LR model addresses the limitations of ordinary LR by automatically discovering symbolic functions without linear assumptions. The model's performance is validated through synthetic data modeling and a case study on porphyry Cu\u2013Mo polymetallic deposits in the Eastern Tianshan region, demonstrating its robustness in predicting mineral prospectivity.",
