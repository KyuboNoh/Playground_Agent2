  "abstract": "Mineral prospectivity maps were produced for gold in two greenstone belts in the Superior geological province in Ontario, Canada, as part of the Metal Earth Project. These maps cover the well-endowed Matheson area and the less fertile Dryden area. Newly identified areas for follow-up gold exploration are associated with major faults and 3D geophysical data. Observations not used in mineral prospectivity mapping may describe why the Matheson greenstone belt is more fertile with respect to gold mineralization than the Dryden greenstone belt.",
