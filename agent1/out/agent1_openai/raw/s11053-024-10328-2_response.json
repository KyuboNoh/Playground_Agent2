  "abstract": "This study proposes an interpretable method using association rules to predict mineral prospectivity in the Pangxidong district by incorporating characteristics associated with mineral deposits into mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The Apriori algorithm was utilized to extract strong association rules related to known Ag\u2013Au and Pb\u2013Zn deposits, achieving effective delineation of high-probability areas for undiscovered deposits.",
