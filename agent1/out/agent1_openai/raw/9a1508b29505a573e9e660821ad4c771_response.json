  "Abstract": "This paper employed Random Forests (RF) to generate several Mineral Prospectivity maps for orogenic gold in the Geraldton area, located within the Wabigoon Tectonic subprovince of Ontario, Canada. Various issues pertinent to the Mineral Prospectivity mapping process are presented and proposed solutions to these key challenges are suggested. Additionally, multiple methods are proposed to analyze text-based geoscientific information derived from geological maps, including a novel application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to delineate the sources and traps of gold mineral systems. The Mineral Prospectivity maps generated have located new possible areas for gold exploration.",
