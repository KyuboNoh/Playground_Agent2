  "abstract": "This study proposes a geologically constrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for mapping gold polymetallic mineralization potential in western Henan Province, China. By integrating geological constraints into the CNN model, the study aims to enhance the interpretability and predictive performance of mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The results indicate that combining data-driven approaches with geological knowledge improves the reliability of predictive results.",
