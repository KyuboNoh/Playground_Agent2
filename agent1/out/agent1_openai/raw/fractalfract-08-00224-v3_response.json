  "abstract": "AI-driven mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a valid and increasingly accepted tool for delineating the targets of mineral exploration, but it suffers from noisy and unrepresentative input features. In this study, a set of fractal and multifractal methods were employed to excavate the underlying nonlinear mineralization-related information from geological features. Multiple feature selection criteria were applied to rank the relative importance of ore-related features and their fractal representations. The results indicate that fractal-trained AI models significantly improve predictive capability, especially for indirect predictor features that show subtle correlations with mineralization in the raw dataset.",
