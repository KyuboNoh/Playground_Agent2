  "abstract": "This study proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to integrate multi-source data (geological, geochemical, and geomorphological) to map mineral prospectivity of regolith-hosted REE deposits. A generative adversarial network (GAN) was applied for data augmentation to address the lack of labeled data. The CNN achieved 99.7% training accuracy and 98.9% validation accuracy, successfully locating all known mineral deposits within the prospective areas delineated by the CNN.",
