  "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of non-deposit sites on mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) using machine learning algorithms in the Pitangui Greenstone Belt, Brazil. It highlights the importance of training datasets and the selection of non-deposit locations, demonstrating that slight changes can significantly affect model performance. The research employs various machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to model gold prospectivity, revealing that RF consistently outperforms others. The findings contribute to improved methodologies for gold exploration in the region.",
