  "abstract": "A mineral prospectivity map (MPM) focusing on gold mineralization in the Larder Lake region of Northern Ontario, Canada, has been produced in this study. We have used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to use 32 predictor maps integrating geophysical, geochemical, and geological datasets from various sources that represent vectors to gold mineralization. It is evident from the efficiency of classification curves that MPMs generated are robust. The unsupervised algorithms, K-means and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to investigate and visualize the clustering nature of large geochemical and geophysical datasets. We conclude that the Larder Lake-Cadillac deformation zone (LLCDZ) is relatively more fertile than the Lincoln-Nipissing shear zone (LNSZ) with respect to gold mineralization due to deeper penetrating faults.",
