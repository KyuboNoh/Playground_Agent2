  "abstract": "This study presents a novel workflow for integrating geological text big data into three-dimensional mineral prospectivity mapping (3DMPM). Focusing on the Xiyu kimberlite-type diamond deposit in Shandong, China, exploration criteria were constructed using text mining technologies. A random forests classification model was applied to predict mineralization, demonstrating the effectiveness of the workflow in coupling geological data and knowledge.",
