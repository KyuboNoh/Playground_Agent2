  "abstract": "The mineral exploration sequence contains field planning, data processing and assessment of results for further decision making. Various exploration layers were synthesised by Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) models to generate an optimal Mineral Prospectivity Map (MPM) of Cu-Au mineralisation in the Sonajil area, NW of Iran. The knowledge-driven method was adopted using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach for preparation of MPM. The resulting map was cross-validated by the results of the petrography study of the samples taken from the mineralised zones indicated by MPM.",
