  "Abstract": "This study utilizes a hybrid model combining a direct sampling algorithm and a convolutional neural network to quantify the uncertainty associated with the evidence layers in mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). A case study of mapping mineral prospectivity for gold polymetallic deposits in the Middle\u2013Lower Yangtze River Valley metallogenic belt in southeastern Hubei Province of China was implemented. The comparative results indicated that the hybrid model achieved a higher success rate and prediction accuracy than the deterministic framework.",
