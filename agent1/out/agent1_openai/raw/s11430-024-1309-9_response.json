  "abstract": "Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is designed to reduce the exploration search space by combining and analyzing geological prospecting big data. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance in MPM but face challenges such as interpretability and generalizability. This study proposes a novel workflow for constructing explainable AI models for MPM by embedding domain knowledge throughout the process, improving model interpretability and performance.",
