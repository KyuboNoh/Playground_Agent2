  "abstract": "Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) is a fundamental technique in geosciences for identifying regions with high mineral potential. This study proposes an Attention-Driven Graph Convolutional Network (ADGCN) that leverages an attention mechanism to select highly correlated nodes and aggregates features from distant nodes for representation learning. In tests conducted in the Lhasa region, ADGCN achieved an AUC of 91.67%, surpassing GAT by 2.65%, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy in MPM.",
