  "Abstract": "The present study applies proposed hybrid mathematical frameworks, namely Data-driven Multi-Index Overlay Method (DMIO) and Best Worst Method-multi objective optimization by ratio analysis (BWM-MOORA) techniques, for generating robust predictive models enhancing mineral prospectivity analysis. These are used for weighting multiple groups of evidence maps acquired from geological databases, such as remote sensing, geological, geochemical, and geophysical, and then integrating these weighted layers into robust predictive models to assess porphyry copper prospectivity.",
