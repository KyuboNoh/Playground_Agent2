  "abstract": "This study aimed to identify potential exploration targets for intrusion-related W\u2013Mo\u2013Sb\u2013Au deposits in the Pokiok Plutonic Suite using knowledge-driven mineral prospectivity mapping techniques. A multifaceted approach combining mineral systems, parsimonious weighting methods, Monte Carlo simulation, and risk-return analysis was adopted to mitigate uncertainties. The methodology allows for confident selection of exploration targets, predicting 73% of known occurrences while reducing the search space by 15%.",
