  "abstract": "This paper aims to reduce uncertainties in mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) for Cu-Au mineralization in the Moalleman District, NE Iran. Efficient evidence layers were translated from geospatial criteria and integrated using an improved data-driven simple additive weight (SAW) procedure. A support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel was also applied for comparison. Results indicated that both models successfully delineated favorable mineralization targets, with SVM proving more reliable.",
