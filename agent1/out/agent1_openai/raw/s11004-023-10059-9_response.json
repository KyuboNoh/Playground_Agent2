  "abstract": "This study constructs a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for mineral prospectivity mapping, tested through a case study in northwest Hubei Province, China. The deep RL agent interacts with the environment to evaluate mineralization potential, outperforming traditional models like random forest and isolation forest. The results indicate strong spatial correlation with known gold deposits, providing valuable insights for future prospecting.",
