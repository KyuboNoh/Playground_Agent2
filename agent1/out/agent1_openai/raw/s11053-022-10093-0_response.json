  "abstract": "This study investigates the use of semi-supervised learning algorithms to enhance mineral prospectivity mapping by selecting unlabeled samples based on their similarity to known mineral deposits. A quasi-Newton method for semi-supervised support vector machine (QN\u2013S3VM) was applied to the Honghai volcanogenic massive sulfide Cu\u2013Zn deposit in eastern Tianshan, China. The results indicate that lower similarity in unlabeled samples improves QN\u2013S3VM performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of similarity measures in sample selection for mineral prospectivity mapping.",
