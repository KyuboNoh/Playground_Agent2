  "abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness of data augmentation in mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to enhance training data, addressing issues of data scarcity and overfitting. The results demonstrate improved model performance, with higher accuracy and reduced overfitting. Various black-box visualization tools were utilized to elucidate the mechanisms by which SMOTE enhances predictive capabilities, revealing significant ore-associated features.",
