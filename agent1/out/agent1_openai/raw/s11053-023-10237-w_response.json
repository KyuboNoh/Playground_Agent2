  "abstract": "This paper proposes a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) that emphasizes interpretability and domain cognitive consistency. The algorithms integrate geological knowledge into AI models, enhance transparency, and improve mineral exploration targeting. Key strategies include building a robust conceptual model, translating it into a practical exploration model, constructing a comprehensive geodatabase, and identifying relevant targeting parameters. The goal is to improve mineral exploration success rates and address shortages of critical metallic elements.",
