  "Abstract": "Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) plays a pivotal role in identifying geo-anomalies indicative of potential mineralization, utilizing various geological, geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing data. This study proposes a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) strategy for data augmentation to address challenges posed by limited geological exploration data. The results indicate that the cGAN-based data augmentation strategy exhibits higher resistance to overfitting, successfully delineating a prospectivity map for gold deposits in the Hezuo-Meiwu district, Gansu, China.",
