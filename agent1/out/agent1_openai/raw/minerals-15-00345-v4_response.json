  "abstract": "Using mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), the mineral systems approach enables the identification of geological indicators linked to ore formation. This approach streamlines exploration by minimizing the time and cost required to identify areas with the highest mineral potential. In northern New Brunswick, the Tobique\u2013Chaleur Zone contains several orogenic and epithermal gold systems. This study employed MPM by translating key mineral system components into mappable criteria for regional-scale analysis, integrating knowledge-based and data-driven methods, including fuzzy logic, geometric average, and logistic regression approaches. The fuzzy overlay model had the highest predictive accuracy (AUC 0.97).",
