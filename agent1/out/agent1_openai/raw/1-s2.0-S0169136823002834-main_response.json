  "abstract": "This study investigates the use of machine learning techniques for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) at the Ashele copper-zinc deposit. By enhancing feature representativeness and analyzing dataset composition, the study constructs predictive models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The results indicate that improved feature selection significantly enhances model performance, achieving predictive accuracies of approximately 0.88. The integrated model successfully identifies mineralized boreholes, demonstrating the efficacy of machine learning in MPM.",
