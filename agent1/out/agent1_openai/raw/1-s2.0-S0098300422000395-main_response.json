  "abstract": "This paper adopts a data augmentation method to enhance mineral prospectivity prediction for gold deposits in the Fengxian Region, China. By utilizing cropping operations, the method generates sufficient training samples while preserving the spatial directions of geological data. The continuous buffer distance method quantifies faults and anticline axes, improving predictive performance. Three convolutional neural networks (LeNet, AlexNet, VggNet) were employed, with LeNet achieving the highest accuracy (91.38%) and Kappa coefficient (0.8119). The results delineate high potential areas for gold exploration.",
