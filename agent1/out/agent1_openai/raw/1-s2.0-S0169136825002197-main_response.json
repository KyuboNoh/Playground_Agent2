  "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models have been successfully adopted to delineate prospecting regions for a specific type of mineral deposit in data-driven mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The primary objective of the ML-based MPM is to effectively integrate multi-source mineral exploration information and enhance its predictive capability and precision. This study employs Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to conduct mineral prospectivity maps, utilizing interpretable machine learning techniques to improve model explainability and performance.",
