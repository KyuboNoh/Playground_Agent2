  "abstract": "This research presents a case study that employs the Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Averaging (FOWA) method to develop mineral prospectivity/potential maps (MPM) for the Chahargonbad district in southeastern Iran. The primary objective of the study is to uncover intricate and concealed relationships between various evidence layers and known ore occurrences through a comprehensive analysis of multi-disciplinary geospatial data. Consequently, thirteen evidence layers were meticulously derived from existing databases, encompassing geological, geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing data, which were then integrated using the FOWA multi-criteria decision-making approach to delineate favorable zones for porphyry Cu mineralization.",
