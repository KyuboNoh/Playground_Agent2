  "abstract": "Gold mineral prospectivity mapping is crucial for identifying potential gold-bearing zones and supporting exploration efforts through advanced data analytics. This study applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to generate gold mineralization maps for Yagba West, utilizing an integrated dataset comprising SRTM DEM, Landsat 8 imagery, geological maps, and aeromagnetic data. The SVM model mapped a 249.58 km\u00b2 gold-prospective area with 96% validation accuracy, while the CART model identified 132.13 km\u00b2 with 97% accuracy. The findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing gold prospectivity mapping and optimizing exploration strategies.",
