  "Abstract": "The Huangling region hosts the only documented Precambrian gold metallogenic event within the Yangtze craton. This study proposes a mineral systems model for the gold deposits in the Huangling region, comprising four key components: geodynamics, fertility, architecture, and preservation. Geological, geophysical, and geochemical proxies were identified. Predictive modeling using random forests (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) demonstrated superior performance, with the CNN model achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.855. The findings underscore the mineral systems approach as a robust tool for prospectivity mapping of orogenic gold deposits.",
