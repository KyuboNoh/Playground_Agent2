  "abstract": "This study proposes an interpretable graph attention network (GAN) for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) of Fe polymetallic mineralization in southwestern Fujian Province, China. The method integrates prior geological knowledge into the GAN structure, enhancing interpretability and generalization. A comparative analysis shows that the interpretable GAN outperforms conventional GANs in identifying high mineralization potential areas.",
