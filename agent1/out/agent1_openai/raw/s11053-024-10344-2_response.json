  "abstract": "This study introduces a novel method for constructing heterogeneous graphs for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The nodes consist of different types of geological entities, and the edges represent the links between them. The constructed heterogeneous graph effectively expresses the spatial anisotropy of mineralization and considers the relationships among geological entities. The method was trained using graph neural networks to obtain a mineral prospectivity map for southwestern Fujian Province, China, demonstrating higher accuracy compared to conventional methods.",
