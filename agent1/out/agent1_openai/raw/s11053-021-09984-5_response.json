  "abstract": "This study demonstrates the application of GMDH neural networks for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) in terrains hosting few but large mineral deposits. Coupled with a window-based data augmentation technique, GMDH networks yield robust predictive models that effectively manage the bias\u2013variance tradeoff, making this methodology a viable option for MPM.",
