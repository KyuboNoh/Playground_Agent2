  "abstract": "This study employs a hybrid of the genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) model to map prospective areas for Au deposits in Karamay, northwest China. GA is used to optimize the SVM parameters that result in the best fitness. After obtaining evidence layers from geological and geochemical data, GA\u2013SVM models trained using different datasets were applied to discriminate between prospective and non-prospective areas for Au deposits. The best model predicted 95.83% of the known Au deposits within prospective areas, occupying 35.68% of the study area.",
