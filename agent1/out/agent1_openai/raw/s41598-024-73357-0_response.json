  "abstract": "This study proposes an ensemble learning approach to synthesize convolutional neural network algorithms for mineral prospectivity prediction. By selecting 14 factors related to gold mineralization and utilizing six classical CNN models, the study achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting mineral prospectivity in the Bawanggou mine area, providing a comprehensive method for gold exploration.",
