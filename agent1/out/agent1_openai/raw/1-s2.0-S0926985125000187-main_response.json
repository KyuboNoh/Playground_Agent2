  "abstract": "This study introduces a multistage algorithm to generate a predictive porphyry intrusion evidential map using magnetic data. The algorithm includes steps such as radial symmetry transformation, non-minimum suppression, amplitude contrast transformation, and active contour algorithm. Implemented on aeromagnetic data from the Pariz region in Iran, the results identified all six known deposits and discovered a new porphyry copper deposit, enhancing mineral prospectivity mapping.",
