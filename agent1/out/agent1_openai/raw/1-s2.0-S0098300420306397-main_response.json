  "abstract": "This study employs a positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) algorithm for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) in southwestern Fujian province, China. The PUL algorithm utilizes only positive and unlabeled samples, avoiding the need for negative training samples. The study examines the sensitivity of the PUL algorithm to different training sets and demonstrates its reproducibility and stability. The results indicate a strong spatial correlation between predictive variables and known mineral deposits, with PUL outperforming other methods like one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN).",
