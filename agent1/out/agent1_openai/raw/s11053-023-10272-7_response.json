  "abstract": "This study constructs a framework to improve data-driven mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) in the Qulong\u2013Jiama mineral district of Tibet. It addresses the interpretability of black box models and bias in high-prospectivity areas. The mineral systems concept is applied to select targeting criteria, and model-agnostic methods are used to interpret machine learning models. An ensemble method combines bootstrapping and Random Forest to generate modulated prediction models, identifying exploration targets that occupy just 3% of the study area.",
