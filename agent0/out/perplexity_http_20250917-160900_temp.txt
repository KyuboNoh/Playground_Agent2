Various statistical techniques have been developed to differentiate abnormal values from background values. A more accurate analysis can be obtained by employing multivariate statistical methods. The use of these methods enables the simultaneous analysis of changes in multiple variables. This research utilized correlation coefficients, cluster analysis, and factor analysis to demonstrate the genetic connections among various elements. The factor analysis method was additionally applied to generate multivariable maps and comprehensive multivariable results. Moreover, the stepwise factor analysis (SFA) method, an enhanced version of traditional factor analysis, was utilized to produce geochemical distribution maps. This technique entails initially recognizing and removing non-representative elements, followed by identifying the most important and impactful representative factors. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the SFA method when applied to geochemical data. This approach removes superfluous elements and increases the variance attributed to the predictive mineralization factor, thereby improving the geochemical halos. Additionally, this research evaluated multivariate analysis approaches alongside machine learning techniques. To achieve this, a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) was used to evaluate the levels of gold, silver, copper, lead, and ..."},

Today\u2019s economic development is inseparable from the support of metal mineral resources. With the continuous exploitation of shallow and easily identifiable mines in China, the prospecting work of deep and hidden mines is very important. Mineral prospectivity modeling (MPM) is an important means to improve the efficiency of mineral exploration. With the increase in resource demands and exploration difficulty, the traditional 2DMPM is often difficult to use to reflect the information of deep mineral deposits. More large-scale deposits are needed to carry out 3DMPM research. With the rise of artificial intelligence, the combination of machine learning and geological big data has become a hot issue in the field of 3DMPM. In this paper, a case study of 3DMPM is carried out based on the Xuancheng\u2013Magushan area\u2019s actual data. Two machine learning methods, the random forest and the logistic regression, are selected for comparison. The results show that the 3DMPM based on random forest method performs better than the logistic regression method. It can better characterize the corresponding relationship between the geological structure combination and the metallogenic distribution, and the accuracy in the test set reaches 96.63%. This means that the random forest model could provide more effective and accurate support for integrating predictive data during 3DMPM. ..."},

Manganese mineralization is predicted, and areas with high mineralization potential are delineated. The results of the feature factor weight analysis indicate that structural density and lithological characteristics contribute most significantly to manganese mineralization. Notably, linear structures are aligned with the direction of the manganese belt, and areas exhibiting high controlling structural density are closely associated with the locations of mineral deposits, suggesting that structure plays a crucial role in manganese production in this region. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for the Random Forest (RF), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were 0.975, 0.983, and 0.916, respectively, indicating that all three models achieved a high level of performance and interpretability. Among these, the NB model demonstrated the highest performance. By algebraically overlaying the predictions from these three machine learning models, a comprehensive mineralization favorability map was generated, identifying 11 prospective mineralization zones. The performance metrics of the machine learning models validate their robustness, while regional tectonics and stratigraphic lithology provide ..."},

Several approaches have been proposed to learn the deep characteristics of geoscience data, enhance the accuracy of prediction and reduce uncertainty. Nevertheless, the approaches always contain the following two limitations. Firstly, the formation of mineral resources often involves the coupling of multiple factors on a certain spatio-temporal scale, resulting in rare labelled deposits and insufficient number of training samples. Secondly, training Deep Neural Network (DNN) is very challenging. Many approaches are subject to weak interpretability and lack of organic combination with geoscience knowledge. To address these two problems, we propose Geo-Rnet and GCAE (Geological Convolutional Autoencoder). Geo-Rnet is a multi-class mineral prospectivity prediction approach based on improved DNN. GCAE is able to effectively augment multi-disciplinary geoscience data by constructing upon an optimized Convolutional Autoencoder. The experimental results show that most of prospective areas predicted by Geo-Rnet overlap with the labelled mineralization locations, with an average accuracy of 91.1%. In addition, 89.98% of the ore deposits are located in the predicted areas. The results indicate the effectiveness of Geo-Rnet and GCAE for multi-class prediction of mineral resources. Finally, we classify the target area into several ..."},

In areas with strong surface weathering, the accumulation centres of surface geochemical anomalies are often not completely matched with locations of mineral deposits. This affects anomaly interpretation and mineral prospectivity prediction. In order to solve this challenging problem, quantitative prediction of mineral prospectivity based on multi-information fusion techniques has been one of the research hotspots in the field of data analysis in recent years. This study first summarized the geological background and metallogenic control factors of each tectonic unit in Guangxi, and then analysed the relationship between Pb\u2013Zn deposits and Pb\u2013Zn geochemical anomalies from 60 767 geochemical stream sediment samples. Based on the re-classified geochemical element contents, gravity, aeromagnetic data and fault, magmatic rock, magmatic rock and fault intersection buffer data as input layers, together with 302 Pb\u2013Zn ore occurrences selected as training data sets, quantitative prediction of prospectivity for Pb\u2013Zn ore deposits in the study area was carried out using back-propagation neural network and fuzzy weights-of-evidence methods.
